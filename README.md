# Eternal Engine

Ever wanted to collect all of your discord servers in a single place? Ever wanted to create your own local parallel discord infrastructure?

The Eternal Engine got you, it uses mongodb for setting up data, has a simple onboarding process at the very start where you specify some information it needs to run. Its completely local and everything it produces is yours only.

Has a ton of features I forgot.

## To-Do
- Organize concept and documentation of project
- Clear up some parts of the code
